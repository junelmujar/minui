# MinUI 

A minimalist UI framework inspired by Material Design Lite and Bootstrap

## Why another UI library?

This library was created as an exercise / experiment for the author. The goal was to emulate the best bits of MD and Bootstrap in a simplified form and at the same not use jQuery for the Javascript bits.

## Components

- Dropdowns
- Buttons
- Tabs
- Cards
- Form
- Table
- Tooltips
- Alerts
- Modal
- Nav
- Grid
- Typography

And that's about it! Basic stuff to build your app.
