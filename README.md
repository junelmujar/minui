# MinUI 

A minimalist UI framework inspired by Material Design Lite and Bootstrap

## Why another UI library?

This library was created as an exercise / experiment for the author. The goal was to emulate the best bits of MD and Bootstrap in a simplified form and at the same not use jQuery for the Javascript bits.

## Components

- Dropdowns
- Buttons
- Tabs
- Cards
- Form
- Table
- Tooltips
- Alerts
- Modal

And that's about it! Basic stuff to build your app.

## Status

As of now it's in its baby form, and needs tons of refactoring. It's fairly usable in its current form. 8)

## Future plans

- refactor JS and split bits of code for each component that uses it (e.g: tabs, dropdowns, material design form inputs, modal)
- refactor/optimize LESS code
- improve code structure
- add build/minification for JS and LESS bits
- add browser tests
